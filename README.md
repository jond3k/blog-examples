blog code
===

When I paste any code on [my blog](http://jond3k.wordpress.com) that wont fit inside a Gist, but is too small to be a project in its own right, I'll instead place it in this repository.

Currently this repo contains code for:

1. [Catching segfaults when using sun.misc.Unsafe](http://jond3k.wordpress.com/2013/01/06/catching-unsafe-seg-faults/)

Use any of this code freely. Feedback (peer review) is encouraged.

You can get in touch by [emailing me](mailto:me@jond3k.com), read my online CV on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=42331263) or see what I occasionally have to say on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jond3k).
