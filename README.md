blog code
===

When I paste any code on my blog, [statemachina.com](http://statemachina.com), that wont fit inside a Gist but is too small to be a project in its own right, I'll instead place it in this repository.

Currently this repo contains code for:

1. [Catching segfaults when using sun.misc.Unsafe](http://statemachina.wordpress.com/2013/01/06/catching-jvm-seg-faults/)

Use any of this code freely. Feedback (peer review) is encouraged.

You can get in touch by emailing me at [jon@statemachina.com](mailto:jon@statemachina.com), read my online CV on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=42331263) or see what I occasionally have to say on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/jond3k).
